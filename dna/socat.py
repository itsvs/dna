class SocatHelper:
    """The ``socat`` helper class that binds container ports to unix sockets

    The motivation behind using ``socat`` is that simply having docker publish
    ports and having nginx proxy to them would result in host ports having to be
    defined and occupied. The better solution is to have an additional lightweight
    container that can bridge to each service and bind its port to a socket. This
    socket is created in a folder that is located on the host but mounted to the
    ``socat`` container, so that the host's nginx webserver may proxy to it.
