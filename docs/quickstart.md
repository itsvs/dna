# Quickstart

A rudimentary example of how the `docker-dna` library may be used. We will demonstrate the basic
features of the app by creating a simple Flask app.

```{important}
Before continuing, make sure you've installed docker, nginx, and certbot for your distribution.

* [Docker Engine](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux)
* [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html)
* [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) (My HTTP website is running Nginx on `distribution`)
```
